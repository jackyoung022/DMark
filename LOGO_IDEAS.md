# DMark Logo Design Concept

## Concept 1: Minimalist Text-Based
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for "DMark".
- Consider a dark blue or black color to convey professionalism and reliability.
- The 'D' could be stylized with a subtle geometric element, like a corner fold or a small icon integrated into the letter.

## Concept 2: Icon + Text
- A simple, abstract icon representing markdown or document management.
  - A stylized "D" that looks like a document corner.
  - An icon combining a hash symbol (#) with a folder or document.
- Pair the icon with the "DMark" text.

## Concept 3: Monogram
- Use the letters "DM" in a bold, geometric style.
- This could be a single shape that combines both letters.

## Color Palette Suggestions
- Primary: Dark Blue (#2C3E50) or Black (#000000)
- Secondary: Light Gray (#ECF0F1) or White (#FFFFFF)
- Accent: A vibrant color like Orange (#E67E22) or Green (#2ECC71) for a modern touch.

## Additional Notes
- The logo should be scalable and look good in both color and black & white.
- Consider how it will look on a website favicon.
